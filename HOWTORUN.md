- We will press the server-txt2app toggle button, the first time you start this application it will take between 1 and 2 minutes, depending on your machine and internet connection, this happens because the NodeJS server dependencies are being installed.

- If everything goes well, your browser will open automatically with the web app, which may indicate that it is still loading as shown below.

- Finally, when the app is completely ready to use, it will look like the one below. You can now start creating an app, although if you leave the box empty, we will create a sample app for you.
